# Baofeng DM-32UV programming protocol

Reverse engineered from `DMR CPS.exe` v1.60 (2026-06-08) with Ghidra.
Addresses such as `0x44a210` refer to that binary. **Everything here comes
from static analysis only and has not been checked against a real radio yet.**

## Serial link

- 115200 baud, 8N1, DTR and RTS asserted (`FUN_0048f400`, `[com]` section of `cps.ini`)
- The CPS waits 10 ms before each send. Default receive timeout is 500 ms;
  4 KB block reads and writes use 5000 ms.

## Session (codeplug read/write, `FUN_0044a210`)

Menu IDs: Program → Read = 32778, Write = 32779. Both open the same dialog.
It passes mode 0 for read and 1 for write, and runs `FUN_0044a210` in a worker thread.

| # | Send | Expect | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | `PSEARCH` | 8 bytes, `[0] == 0x06` | Retried up to 5 times. Bytes 1–7 are probably a model ID. |
| 2 | `PASSSTA` | 3 bytes: `'P' rd wr` | `rd == 0xA5` means a read password is set; `wr == 0xA5` means a write password is set. |
| 2a | `PASWORD` | `0x06` | Only when the flag for the current direction is `0xA5`. |
| 2b | `'P' ('R'\|'W') pw[8]` (10 bytes) | 1 byte | Password is ASCII, padded with 0xFF, NUL-terminated if shorter than 8. |
| 3 | `SYSINFO` | 1 byte (`0x06`) | |
| 4 | `V 00 00 40 0D` | `'V' x n` then `n` bytes | Radio info blob |
| 5 | `V 00 00 00 i` for i = 1..16, except 12 | `'V' x n` then `n` bytes | See the V table below |
| 6r | read: `G 00 00 00 00 01` | 0x106 bytes: `'S'` + 5-byte header + 256 data bytes | 256-byte settings block |
| 6w | write: `S 00 00 00 00 01` + 256 bytes | `0x06` (5 s timeout) | Only sent if that block was loaded |
| 7 | `FF FF FF FF 0C` | — | Same bytes as CHIRP `baofeng_uv17` `_magics2` |
| 8 | `PROGRAM` | `0x06` | Radio enters programming mode |
| 9 | `02` | 8 bytes | Identification |
| 10 | `06` | `0x06` | |
| 11 | page scan, block transfer | | See below |

### V queries

The payload for each is `n` bytes. Multi-byte values are little-endian.

| i | Meaning |
|---|---------|
| 1 | Model / version string (shown in the dialog title) |
| 10 | `u32 start, u32 end`: flash range of the **codeplug page area** |
| 15 | `u32 start, u32 end`: flash range of the **digital contacts area** |
| 16 | `u24`: contacts data length in bytes (44 = 0x2C bytes per contact) |
| others | Read and counted, not yet interpreted |

## Block commands

```
Read:   'R' a0 a1 a2 l0 l1          -> 'W' a0 a1 a2 l0 l1 data[l]
Write:  'W' a0 a1 a2 l0 l1 data[l]  -> 0x06
```

The address is 24-bit little-endian and the length is 16-bit little-endian. Normal transfers use l = 0x1000 (one 4 KB flash page).

## Codeplug storage: tagged 4 KB pages

The codeplug is not one contiguous image. The flash between `V10.start` and
`V10.end` is split into 4 KB pages, and **the last byte of each page (offset
0xFFF) is a tag** saying what the page holds. `0xFF` means the page is free.

1. **Scan:** for each page, read 1 byte at `page + 0xFFF` (`R .. 01 00` returns 7 bytes, the last being the tag).
2. **Read:** for each wanted tag, find its page and read the whole 4 KB.
3. **Write:** for each tag, write to the page that already has that tag,
   or else to the first free page. The tag byte stays at offset 0xFFF.

| Tags | Pages | CPS buffer | Probable contents (unverified) |
|------|-------|------------|-------------------------------|
| 0x02, 0x03, 0x04, 0x06, 0x0A, 0x0B, 0x0F, 0x10, 0x11, 0x65, 0x66, 0x67 | 1 each | separate buffers | settings, zones, scan lists, etc. |
| 0x12 – 0x41 | 48 | one 192 KB buffer | probably channels (for example 4000 × 48 B) |
| 0x42 – 0x43 | 2 | | |
| 0x44 – 0x48 | 5 | continues the tag 0x0B buffer at +0x1000 | |
| 0x5C – 0x64 | 9 | | |

Digital contacts are stored **linearly** from `V15.start`, in 44-byte records, and read or written as 4 KB blocks. First `R start 04 00` returns 4 bytes of length information.

## Other routines in the CPS (not needed for CHIRP)

| Function | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `0x45e530` / `0x45f6b0` / `0x45fff0` | Factory calibration page (tag 0x02 at page end in its own region) plus `AT+...` alignment. **Never write.** |
| `0x44da70`, `0x450e10`, `0x452b20` | Call recording list and playback |
| `0x423a60` | Firmware upgrade (bootloader protocol) |
| `0x41d280`, `0x41fea0`, `0x42c9a0` | Voice prompt, font and boot image upload |
| `0x405490`, `0x405a30`, … | Factory test mode (`PCTESTM`, `AT+...`) |

## Open questions

- Byte meanings of the PSEARCH, `02` and V replies; they will come from the first real capture.
- Whether the radio needs an explicit end-of-session command. The CPS just closes the port.
- Which tag is which: diff captures after changing one setting at a time.
- The CPS `.enc` file format (only needed to import CPS files).
